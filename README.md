# Introduction
Urban heat islands (UHIs) pose significant challenges to city living, affecting health, energy consumption, and overall quality of life. Munich, like many other urban areas, experiences variations in temperature across its districts due to differences in infrastructure, vegetation, and urban planning. This project aims to map and analyze the urban heat phenomenon across Munich on a district level to inform better urban planning and mitigate heat effects.

# What is the Google Earth Engine?
Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. It provides a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary-scale analysis capabilities. Researchers, scientists, and hobbyists can leverage Earth Engine to detect changes, map trends, and quantify differences on the Earth's surface using Google's infrastructure.

# About the Project
The Urban Heat Analysis in Munich Districts project utilizes Google Earth Engine to analyze satellite imagery and environmental data to map urban heat intensity across Munich's districts. This analysis aims to identify heat hotspots, understand the contributing factors to increased temperatures, and assess the impact of urban planning on heat distribution.
